Recommendations for how to Improve the Project:

1. Proto3.js wokrs but is fragile in its current state. 
	- See if it is possible to use an API call to validate screennames before pushing to main account
	- Add the ability for the user to add and/or delete multiple screenames at one time before needing to run proto3.js

2. Web Page Search Function
	- Format the output of the search function to show each result on a new line rather that split with underscores

3. Twitter and Database Account
	- The database and twitter accounts for this project are attached to a personal email account. The database might be alright but
	  the twitter account will not remain accessable after the conclusion of this semester. It may be possible to transfer the privileges.
          If this is something you would like to pursue please contact me at vwil311@yahoo.com.

4. File Names
	- The names of the files do not reflect their purpose closesly enough (proto1.js, proto2.js, proto3.js). Changes these names and 
	  thoroughly test the entire application to ensure functionality.

5. Database "Symbol" Element
	- In the database, there is a spacing named "symbol" that is being defaulted to "none" and is not currently being utilized. It was originally
	  intended to help facilitate the search function but was later deprecated for a better method. Either remove this element or find some other 
          way to utilize it and repopulate the database with correctly formatted tweets.
